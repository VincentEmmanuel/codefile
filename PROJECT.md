# MCP Code Server - Project Overview

## 🎯 What is MCP Code Server?

MCP Code Server is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that gives AI assistants like Claude the ability to interact with your local filesystem and codebase. It acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your development environment, enabling powerful code analysis, file manipulation, and project management capabilities.

## 🤔 The Problem It Solves

When working with AI assistants on programming tasks, you often need to:
- Share code files and project structures
- Search through codebases for specific patterns
- Make edits to multiple files
- Understand project dependencies and organization

Traditionally, this requires manual copy-pasting, which is:
- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Limited to small code snippets
- Difficult for maintaining context across files
- Impossible for automated analysis

**MCP Code Server solves this by giving AI assistants direct, controlled access to your filesystem.**

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- **Developers** who want AI assistance with their local projects
- **Teams** looking to accelerate code reviews and refactoring
- **Learners** who want AI to help them understand codebases
- **Anyone** working with code who uses Claude or other MCP-compatible AI assistants

## 🔧 How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌────────────────┐
│   Claude    │ <-----> │  MCP Code    │ <-----> │ Your Codebase  │
│   Desktop   │   MCP   │   Server     │  File   │ & File System  │
└─────────────┘         └──────────────┘  I/O    └────────────────┘
```

1. **You** ask Claude to perform a task (e.g., "Find all TODO comments")
2. **Claude** uses MCP Code Server's tools to access your files
3. **MCP Code Server** safely executes the requested operations
4. **Results** are returned to Claude to provide you with insights

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Smart Code Search**
- Search across entire codebases with regex support
- Get context around matches
- Filter by file types
- Case-sensitive/insensitive options

### 2. **Project Intelligence**
- Automatically detect project type (Node.js, Python, Rust, etc.)
- Analyze project structure and dependencies
- Find entry points and configuration files
- Generate project statistics

### 3. **Safe File Operations**
- Read, write, and edit files
- Create directory structures
- Move and rename files
- All with path validation and safety checks

### 4. **Developer Utilities**
- Execute shell commands
- Parse JSON/YAML files
- Calculate file hashes
- Encode/decode content

## 📚 Real-World Use Cases

### Code Review & Refactoring
```
You: "Find all functions longer than 50 lines and suggest refactoring"
Claude: *Uses MCP Code Server to analyze your codebase and provide specific suggestions*
```

### Documentation Generation
```
You: "Create API documentation for all public methods in the src folder"
Claude: *Scans your code and generates comprehensive documentation*
```

### Bug Investigation
```
You: "Find all places where we're not handling errors properly"
Claude: *Searches for try-catch blocks and error handling patterns*
```

### Project Onboarding
```
You: "Help me understand how this project is structured"
Claude: *Analyzes the project and explains the architecture*
```

### Dependency Analysis
```
You: "Which files depend on the database module?"
Claude: *Traces dependencies and shows the connection graph*
```

## 🔒 Security & Safety

- **Path Validation**: All file paths are normalized and validated
- **Controlled Access**: Only operates within specified directories
- **No Arbitrary Execution**: Commands have timeouts and safety checks
- **Ignore Patterns**: Automatically skips sensitive directories (.git, node_modules)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install**: Run `npm install` in the project directory
2. **Configure**: Add MCP Code Server to your Claude Desktop config
3. **Use**: Start asking Claude to help with your code!

Example first commands:
- "Analyze the structure of my current project"
- "Search for TODO comments in all JavaScript files"
- "Show me the largest files in this project"

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (glob for file searching, js-yaml for parsing)
- **Compatibility**: Windows, macOS, Linux

## 📊 Why Use MCP Code Server?

### Without MCP Code Server:
- ❌ Manual copy-paste of code
- ❌ Limited context awareness
- ❌ No automated analysis
- ❌ Time-consuming file navigation

### With MCP Code Server:
- ✅ Direct codebase access
- ✅ Full project context
- ✅ Automated analysis and edits
- ✅ Efficient development workflow

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

This server enables AI assistants to:
- Perform automated code reviews
- Generate comprehensive test suites
- Refactor entire codebases
- Create documentation from code
- Analyze security vulnerabilities
- And much more...

## 📝 Summary

MCP Code Server transforms AI assistants from simple Q&A tools into powerful development partners that can understand, analyze, and work with your entire codebase. It's like giving your AI assistant the ability to see and interact with your code the way you do - but with superhuman speed and pattern recognition.
