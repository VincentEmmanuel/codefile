# Simple GitHub Setup Guide

You're right - you can keep it simple and just use GitHub! Here's all you need to do:

## 1. Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME

In these files, replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:
- `README.md`
- `install.sh` 
- `install.ps1`

## 2. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `mcp-code-server`
3. Make it public
4. Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

## 3. Push Your Code

```bash
cd C:\MCP\MCP-Code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mcp-code-server.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. That's It! ðŸŽ‰

Users can now install your MCP server with:

**One-line install:**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mcp-code-server/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mcp-code-server/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mcp-code-server.git
```

## What About npm?

You DON'T need npm to make this work! The GitHub approach is:
- âœ… Simpler to set up
- âœ… No npm account needed
- âœ… Still easy for users (one command)
- âœ… You control updates by pushing to GitHub

The npm approach (like Desktop Commander uses) has benefits:
- Auto-updates with `npx -y`
- Shorter commands
- Package versioning

But GitHub-only works great for most use cases!

## Files You Can Ignore for GitHub-Only

If you're only using GitHub, you can ignore:
- `PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md` (npm publishing guide)
- `README.npm.md` (npm-specific readme)
- `bin/setup.js` (the enhanced setup for npm)
- npm-related parts of `package.json`

Just keep:
- âœ… Your main code files
- âœ… `install.sh` and `install.ps1`
- âœ… Basic `README.md`
- âœ… Documentation

## Summary

Yes, you just need to:
1. Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME in the files
2. Push to GitHub
3. Share the install commands

That's it! No npm, no complex setup. Just GitHub. ðŸš€
